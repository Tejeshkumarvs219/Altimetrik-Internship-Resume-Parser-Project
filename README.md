This repository contains the codes for a resume parser. The app.py contains the main code where information such as education, experience, skills etc. are extracted from resumes and job descriptions and matched to find the similarity score between them. Multiple resumes can be uploaded against one job description to find which resume matches the best with the given job description. The code uses the SpaCy library and NER (named entity recognition) to label each word/entity in the pdf and group them into appropriate arrays. The skills are converted into vectors and the similarity score is calculated using cosine similarity. The "templates" folder contains two html files which acts as the front end for this project. The "upload" html file is where the user can upload resumes and job descriptions to be matched and the "results" html file is where the scores are displayed out of 100. The "static" folder contains the "styles" CSS file which is used to make the front end more user-friendly.
